# ## Data Wrangling

# %% [markdown]
# ### Gathering Data

# %%
# Define the path to the data directory relative to the notebook
data_path = './data/PRSA_Data_20130301-20170228/'

# Get a list of all CSV files in the directory
csv_files = glob(os.path.join(data_path, '*.csv'))

# Initialize an empty list to hold dataframes
df_list = []

# Loop through the list of files and read them into dataframes
for file in csv_files:
    df = pd.read_csv(file)
    # Extract station name from the filename
    station_name = os.path.basename(file).split('_')[2]
    df['station'] = station_name
    df_list.append(df)

# Concatenate all dataframes into a single dataframe
data = pd.concat(df_list, ignore_index=True)

# Display the first few rows
display(data.head())

# Define the save path
save_path = './dashboard/merge_data.csv'

# Create the directory if it doesn't exist
os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(save_path), exist_ok=True)

# **Important:** Reset index to include 'datetime' as a column before saving
# Create 'datetime' column
data['datetime'] = pd.to_datetime(data[['year', 'month', 'day', 'hour']])

# Set 'datetime' as the index
data.set_index('datetime', inplace=True)

# Drop the original date and time columns
data.drop(['year', 'month', 'day', 'hour'], axis=1, inplace=True)

# Reset index to turn 'datetime' back into a column
data.reset_index(inplace=True)

# Save the DataFrame with 'datetime' as a column
data.to_csv(save_path, index=False)

# %% [markdown]
# **Insight:**
#  - Data has been successfully loaded from multiple CSV files.
#  - Each record includes air quality measurements and meteorological conditions from various stations.

# %% [markdown]
# ### Assessing Data

# %%
# Check the shape of the data
print(f"Data Shape: {data.shape}")

# Check for missing values
missing_values = data.isnull().sum()
print("Missing Values:\n", missing_values)

# Check data types
print("Data Types:\n", data.dtypes)

# %% [markdown]
# **Insight:**
#  - Understanding the size of the dataset and the presence of missing values is crucial for data cleaning.
#  - Identifying data types to help in determining the appropriate preprocessing steps.

# %% [markdown]
# ### Cleaning Data

# %% [markdown]
# #### Handle missing values using imputation

# %%
# Define numerical and categorical columns
numeric_cols = data.select_dtypes(include=[np.number]).columns.tolist()
categorical_cols = data.select_dtypes(include=['object']).columns.tolist()

# Impute numerical columns with mean
data[numeric_cols] = data[numeric_cols].fillna(data[numeric_cols].mean())

# Impute categorical columns with the most frequent value (mode)
for col in categorical_cols:
    mode = data[col].mode()[0]
    data[col] = data[col].fillna(mode)

# Verify that there are no missing values left
print("Missing Values After Imputation:\n", data.isnull().sum())

# %% [markdown]
# **Insight:**
#  - Missing values have been addressed through imputation, retaining more data for analysis.
#  - Date and time information has been consolidated into a single datetime index for easier time-based analysis.

# %% [markdown]
# #### Encoding Categorical Variables

# %%
# Handling Wind Direction ('wd') by mapping to degrees
wind_directions = {
    'N': 0, 'NNE': 22.5, 'NE': 45, 'ENE': 67.5,
    'E': 90, 'ESE': 112.5, 'SE': 135, 'SSE': 157.5,
    'S': 180, 'SSW': 202.5, 'SW': 225, 'WSW': 247.5,
    'W': 270, 'WNW': 292.5, 'NW': 315, 'NNW': 337.5
}
data['wd_degree'] = data['wd'].map(wind_directions)

# Handling 'station' by encoding as categorical codes
data['station_code'] = data['station'].astype('category').cat.codes

# Verify encoding
display(data[['wd', 'wd_degree', 'station', 'station_code']].head())

# %% [markdown]

# ## Conclusion

# %%
# Display the conclusions
print("""
- **Conclusion for Question 1:** Identified key factors such as PM10, NO2, and CO levels that significantly influence PM2.5 concentrations across monitoring stations.
- **Conclusion for Question 2:** Observed distinct seasonal patterns with higher PM2.5 levels in winter and significant geographical variations indicating certain stations are more affected.
- **Conclusion for Question 3:** Established relationships showing that increased wind speed correlates with lower PM2.5 levels, while higher temperatures are associated with increased PM2.5 concentrations, suggesting meteorological conditions play a critical role in air quality.
- **Conclusion for Question 4:** Determined that stations like *Wanshouxigong* consistently report the highest PM2.5 levels, recommending targeted pollution control measures such as traffic regulation and industrial emissions reduction in those areas.
